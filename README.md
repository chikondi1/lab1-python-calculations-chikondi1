# Lab 1 â€“ Calculations with Python

The script uses measurements of land in Kenya to determine what the amount of runoff from rainfall is. In order to do this, measurements of the area of land were used, and much of the script is converting to use different units. Using  basic mathematics, and knowledge of unit conversions, the measurements given were enough to figure out how much runoff occurs.
